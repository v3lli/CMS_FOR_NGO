Dear HR Manager:

This letter is to express my interest in your posting on Dice.com for an experienced Software Developer. With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Master’s degree in Information Technology, and hands-on experience using .Net languages to create and implement software applications, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.

I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.

Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:

Highly skilled in designing, testing, and developing software
Thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms
Knowledgeable of back-end development best practices
Hands-on software troubleshooting experience
Proven track record of proper documentation for future maintenance and upgrades
I’ve attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience in software development. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, 555-555-5555 or via email at name@gmail.com.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Sincerely,

Your Signature (hard copy letter)
